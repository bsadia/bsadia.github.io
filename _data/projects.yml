- name: Tactile Rendering of Digital Buttons and Shapes on Touchscreens using Novel Surface Haptics Technologies
  descr: "In this work, we proposed a data-driven approach for creating tactile feedback that simulates the feeling of physical buttons on touchscreens. Moreover, we investigated how users perceive tactile graphics displayed to them on touch surfaces and what exploratory procedures are followed to perceive them."

- name:  Patient Specific Pre-Operative Surgery Planning for Laparoscopic Surgery
  descr: "In this work, I developed a method for pre-operative surgery planning of acute cholecystectomy. 3D patient specific tetrahedral anatomical model was generated from CT scan data. Simulation was developed for acute cholecystitis surgery from 3D models in Open Simulation Framework Architecture (SOFA) software. A virtual environment was developed as a result of constructed model and simulation for surgeon to practice before performing actual surgery."

- name:  Multi-Objective Optimization using Evolutionary Computation
  descr: "Most real world search and optimization problems naturally involve multiple objectives. The problem cannot be optimized using single-objective optimization when the rest of the objectives are also important. The aim of this project was to design a user-friendly toolbox for multi-objective optimization using evolutionary computation. Decision parameters were optimized for conflicting objective problems."
